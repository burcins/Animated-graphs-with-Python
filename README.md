# Animated-graphs-with-Python


In this self-developed project my aim is to practice visualizations in Python. I created animated graphs by using Plotly after cleaning the datasets. The datasets published under (Banks Association of Turkey official webpage)[https://www.tbb.org.tr/tr/bankacilik/banka-ve-sektor-bilgileri/istatistiki-raporlar/59]. But unfortunately i could not find English version of the webpage. However I added the used datasets under this Repository for re-run the codes.
